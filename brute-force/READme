***Brute Force attack is illegal and not promoted***
***This is purely for educational purposes. Do not recreate this on authentic websites even if you own them***

How to simulate brute-force attack:
1. Download the folder. 
2. Move the .py file to your working directory 
3. Run it on the virtual environment for the project.
4. This should try all combos on the IoT website. 
Once it hits a correct one (e.g., iot:admin123), it will stop and show success.

This shows how brute force attacks are carried out for websites.

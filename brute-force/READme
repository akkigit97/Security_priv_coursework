***Brute Force attack is illegal and not promoted***
***This is purely for educational purposes. Do not recreate this on authentic websites even if you own them***

How to simulate brute-force attack:
1. Download the folder. 
2. Wordlist.txt contains the combinations of usernames and passwords.
3. Run attack.py script. 
4. This should try all combos on the IoT website. 
Once it hits a correct one (e.g., iot:admin123), it will stop and show success.

This shows how brute force attacks are carried out for websites.
